Starting out from 0 on this assignment, as I have virtually no experience in making android apps and flutter as a whole. This is the best I could make it in the time given to me.

UI design is mostly complete, my vision was to make it like the Google Keep Notes app (in dark mode) with it's clean borders and tiles.

As for this build, there are no forms for the add/edit button, no database functionality and all buttons simply output to console.

There is a scrollable list view, made with manually inserted rows, acting as placeholders for proof of concept. The image is just an asset image downloaded from google photos.
